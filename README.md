# üè¶ Loan Status Prediction using SVM

This project uses a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model to predict the approval status of a loan application based on various features.
The model is trained on structured data and deployed using a **Streamlit web app** for user-friendly interaction.

## Features

- Predicts loan approval status (`Y` = Approved, `N` = Rejected)
- Trained using Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Model saved and loaded using `joblib`
- Interactive web app interface with Streamlit
- Accepts real-time user input for predictions

## Input Features

The model uses the following input columns:
